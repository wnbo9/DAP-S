# Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors using Pseudo Importance Resampling (DAP-PIR)

## Overview

`dap` is an R package that helps users to fit linear models. It can be used to carry out linear regression and output the details of the fitting result. Furthermore, it can carry out analysis of covariance (ANOVA) and there is also a function `lm_anova_fit` to facilitate ANOVA. In `mypackage`, there is also an internal dataset `mt_cars` to help illustrate to usage of `mypackage`.
