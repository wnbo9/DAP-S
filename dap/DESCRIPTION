Description: This package provides a deterministic approximation of the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients in a linear regression model with a spike-and-slab prior. The approximation is based on the pseudo importance resampling (PIR) algorithm. The package also provides a function to compute the marginal likelihood of the model using the PIR approximation. The package is designed to be used with the 'susieR' package, which provides a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the spike-and-slab regression model. The 'dap' package is particularly useful when the number of predictors is large and the number of observations is small.
